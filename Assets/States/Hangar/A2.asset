  storyText: "Well, that was pretty stupid. You sustain a brutal beating and end up\r
    dumped in a dirty cell. The bars are thick cast iron. The door is old and patched\r
    together with plate metal and thick red wires.\n\nYou have no idea where you\r
    are. And your head hurts.\n\nSo, what to do now, slugger?\n\n1. Wait it\r out.
