    tough to hear yourself think above the thumping machinery. However, in front of\r
    you is the emergency exit door. It has an oversized, cast iron lock hanging from\r
    a bolted handle. You could try picking the lock, or maybe look for a way to pry\r
    it off.\n\nWhat to do?\n\n1. Pick it.\n2. Pry it."
