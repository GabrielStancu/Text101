  storyText: "You slink through the machinery towards 2 skanky looking men. The tall,\r
    scrawny one is carrying an oversized gas-canister-powered arrow shooter, while\r
    the shorter dumpy man has strapped to him at least a dozen small glass bottles\r
    with grey liquid inside.\n\nThe stout fellow finishes cranking a large valve\rn(clockwise
    you notice) and then both men dash off with much haste.\n\nWhat\r to do?\n\n1.
    Quick, uncrank that valve, they were clearly up to no good.\n2.\r Chase the men."
